Run the "run_pyinstaller" script
    (all OSes should have identical scripts;
    the only difference should be the file extension.)

For Mac, also run "maketar"
    (remember to set VERSION in the downloader script)
    (make sure you have a copy of the SolverPro.app wrapper)

NOTES:
    - For Mac, executables only retain their 'chmod +x' attribute when using tarballs
        (Important to keep downloader/fixer scripts recognized as scripts, and not text files)
    - Only changes to scripts should be published (with the exception of mac downloader);
        Not binaries or other distributables that could be handled by a GitHub release
