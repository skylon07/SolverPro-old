Why does SolverPro have/do <something>?
What makes SolverPro useful?


Example 1: Why does SolverPro have units?

Problem:
A block has 12N of force applied to it and weighs 4kg.
How fast is the block accelerating?

We know the "force relationship" applies to the block...
    |> unit: N = kg * m / s^2
    |> object: block { force<N> = mass<kg> * acc<m/s^2> }

"A block has 12N of force ... and weighs 4kg"
    |> block.force = 12
    |> block.mass = 4

"How fast is the block accelerating?"
    |> block.acc
        3 m/s^2
It printed the correct units!

But more than that, it can also check for math errors!
    |> object: block2 { acc = pos<m> / time<s> }
    |> block2.acc = block1.acc
        TODO(use correct error name/msg) Error! Units mismatched: m/s <--> m/s^2
