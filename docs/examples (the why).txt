Why does SolverPro have/do <something>?
What makes SolverPro useful?


    Example 1: Why does SolverPro separate relations (things with '=')
        and aliases (things with ':=')?

Behind the scenes, SolverPro keeps a database of "defined" values and "inferred" values. When using
':=' to set values, this tells the solver to "make a definition". When using '=' to set values,
this tells the solver to "make inferences" on all variables that aren't defined by substituting the
ones that are.
    |> a := 4       # actually define a = 4
    |> b + a = c    # infer b and c given a = 4
    |> b
        c - 4
    |> c
        4 + b
    |> d = 2        # infer d from the equation 'd = 2'; NOT a definition

If you are still wondering why there is a differentiation between '=' and ':=', let's look at
one more example... (Each line could be simplified to b = 2)
    |> b = 2            # looks like a "definition"
    |> 2 = b            # still kind of looks like a "definition"
    |> 4 = b^2          # hm... is this a "definition" or an "inference"?
    |> 8 = b^2 + 2*b    # okay, this is definitely NOT a "definition"
The only way SolverPro could potentially distinguish "inferences" from "definitions" (when only
using '=') is to detect if a relation only contains one variable. But, as shown above, deciding
when to draw the line can get messy. Because it's not really clear when a "definition" becomes an
"inference", the next-best option is to force all relations to be treated as "inferences" and
provide ':=' as a means for making "definitions". On a related note, this is why the
"SingleVariableRelationWarning" will be added; to help people know that using things like 'b = 2'
is discouraged.
