Please note that when the program errors, it does (or should) not process ANY of the last input.
This means if you see any error, the last line might as well never have been entered.
(If you see an "Internal Error", please log it at https://github.com/skylon07/SolverPro/issues/new)

Hint: The errors are sorted in alphabetical order.
      You can also find them quickly by using Ctrl+F (Windows) or Command+F (Mac)


        InterpreterNotImplementedError
    "SolverPro cannot process ... (yet)"
This means that you tried to use a feature that has not been finished, however it will be added
sometime in the future.


        UndefinedIdentifierError
    "An undefined identifier was given: ..."
    "Undefined identifiers were given: ..."
This error occurs in many scenarios. The most common scenario might be that you've tried to make an
alias to something that doesn't exist.
    |> a := 4
    |> a_plus_b := a + b    # b is not defined yet!
        UndefinedIdentifierError
    |> b := 5               # must be set earlier to avoid error
