Please note that when the program errors, it does (or should) not process ANY of the last input.
This means if you see any error, the last line might as well never have been entered.
(If you see an "Internal Error", please log it at https://github.com/skylon07/SolverPro/issues/new)

Hint: The errors are sorted in alphabetical order.
      You can also find them quickly by using Ctrl+F (Windows) or Command+F (Mac)
